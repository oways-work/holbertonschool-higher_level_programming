# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This project focuses on understanding and using lists and tuples in Python. It covers common methods, list comprehensions, and basic data manipulation without importing external modules.

## Requirements
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All files end with a new line
* The first line of all files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* Code uses the `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*)
* All files must be executable

## Files

| `0-print_list_integer.py` | Prints all integers of a list, one per line. |
| `1-element_at.py` | Retrieves an element from a list like in C. |
| `2-replace_in_list.py` | Replaces an element of a list at a specific position. |
| `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py` | Prints all integers of a list, in reverse order. |
| `4-new_in_list.py` | Replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list. |
| `5-no_c.py` | Removes all characters `c` and `C` from a string. |
| `6-print_matrix_integer.py` | Prints a matrix of integers. |
| `7-add_tuple.py` | Adds two tuples. |
| `8-multiple_returns.py` | Returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character. |
| `9-max_integer.py` | Finds the biggest integer of a list. |
| `10-divisible_by_2.py` | Finds all multiples of 2 in a list. |
| `11-delete_at.py` | Deletes the item at a specific position in a list. |
