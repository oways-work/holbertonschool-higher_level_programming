# Python - Inheritance

This project covers the implementation of inheritance in Python. It starts with basic object introspection and moves into creating a class hierarchy for geometric shapes (BaseGeometry -> Rectangle -> Square).

## Tasks Summary
- **0. Lookup**: List attributes and methods.
- **1. My list**: Custom list class with sorted printing.
- **2-4. Type checks**: Functions to verify class and inheritance relationships.
- **5-7. BaseGeometry**: Building a base class with validation logic.
- **8-9. Rectangle**: Inheriting from BaseGeometry to build a Rectangle.
- **10-11. Square**: Inheriting from Rectangle to build a Square.

## Testing
To run the doctests, use the following command:
`python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
