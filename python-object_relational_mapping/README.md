# Python - Object-relational mapping

## Description
This project links two amazing worlds: Databases and Python!
It involves using the `MySQLdb` module to interact with MySQL databases directly, and then transitions to using `SQLAlchemy`, an Object Relational Mapper (ORM), to abstract database interactions into Python objects.

## Tasks
* **0. Get all states**: Script that lists all `states` from the database `hbtn_0e_0_usa`.
* **1. Filter states**: Lists all `states` with a name starting with `N`.
* **2. Filter states by user input**: Lists all `states` where `name` matches the argument.
* **3. SQL Injection...**: Safer version of Task 2.
* **4. Cities by states**: Lists all `cities` from the database `hbtn_0e_4_usa`.
* **5. All cities by state**: Lists all `cities` of a specific `state`.
* **6. First state model**: Definition of a `State` class and an instance `Base = declarative_base()`.
* **7. All states via SQLAlchemy**: Lists all `State` objects from the database `hbtn_0e_6_usa`.
* **8. First state**: Prints the first `State` object from the database `hbtn_0e_6_usa`.
* **9. Contains `a`**: Lists all `State` objects that contain the letter `a`.
* **10. Get a state**: Prints the `State` object with the name passed as argument.
* **11. Add a new state**: Adds the `State` object "Louisiana" to the database.
* **12. Update a state**: Changes the name of the `State` where `id = 2` to "New Mexico".
* **13. Delete states**: Deletes all `State` objects with a name containing the letter `a`.
* **14. Cities in state**: Python file similar to model_state.py named `model_city.py` that contains the class definition of a `City`.
